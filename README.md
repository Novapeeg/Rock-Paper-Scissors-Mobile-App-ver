# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Mobile-App-ver
Created by Novapeeg aka Justin Wilmot- In this project, I decided to create a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer. The game starts with you selecting one of 3 buttons. Each button represents a hand/move in the game. Each move represents a number. Rock represents 1, Paper represents 2 and so on. In the code, Iâ€™ve coded the Computer to randomly choose one of the three options as well (1-3). Depending on what hand/move (number) you chose and what the computer chose, There are 9 different outcomes. After the outcome of the game is revealed, a message appears telling you the specifics of the game- such as what the computer put down to cause your victory or loss. After you either win or lose, I set up for 2 buttons to appear. One of them lets you replay the game, resetting everything, and the other quits the game.
